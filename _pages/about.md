    After earning my M.S. in Computer Science from Yale University in May 2024, I continued my studies at Yale as a visiting student in the Computer Science department, advised by Professor <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/julie-dorsey">Julie Dorsey</a>.
    <div style="line-height: 80%"><br></div>
    I am currently conducting research in computer graphics in collaboration with Professor <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/julie-dorsey">Julie Dorsey</a> and Professor <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/holly-rushmeier">Holly Rushmeier</a>, with a focus on physically based rendering and appearance modeling. I plan to further explore physics-based simulation in the near future.

    I received my B.S. in Mathematics of Computation from UCLA in June 2023.
    Outside of my academic work, I enjoy immersing myself in the wonders of nature and the universe through hiking, stargazing, and photography.
